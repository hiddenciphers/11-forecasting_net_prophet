### **Step 3:** Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns
In this step, the analysis explores the relationship between the search traffic data and the stock price patterns of MercadoLibre. The analysis includes concatenating the stock price data with the search data, calculating lagged search trends, and reviewing the time series correlation.

### **Step 4:** Create a Time Series Model by Using Prophet
The goal of this step is to create a time series model using the Prophet forecasting model to analyze and forecast patterns in the hourly search data. The analysis includes setting up the data for the Prophet model and plotting the forecast.

### **Step 5 (Optional):** Forecast the Revenue by Using Time Series Models
This optional step focuses on forecasting the total sales (revenue) for the next quarter using time series models. The analysis includes applying the Prophet model to the historical sales data and producing a sales forecast.

## **Results and Findings**
The analysis provides insights into the search traffic patterns, seasonality, and their relationship with stock price patterns. It also includes forecasts for search traffic popularity and revenue. The detailed findings and interpretations are documented in the **forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb notebook**.
